# Layered Areas

![Layered Areas](layeredAreas.png)

This demo application belongs to the set of examples for LightningChart JS, data visualization library for JavaScript.

LightningChart JS is entirely GPU accelerated and performance optimized charting library for presenting massive amounts of data. It offers an easy way of creating sophisticated and interactive charts and adding them to your website or web application.

The demo can be used as an example or a seed project. Local execution requires the following steps:

- Make sure that relevant version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed
- Open the project folder in a terminal:

        npm install              # fetches dependencies
        npm start                # builds an application and starts the development server

- The application is available at *http://localhost:8080* in your browser, webpack-dev-server provides hot reload functionality.


## Description

*Also known as a Layered Area Graph, Layered Area Chart or Multiple Area Charts*

Layers mean individual slices of information (series) which can be stacked to create your composition of multiple series within the same chart view using overlapping.

In this example, layered area chart is basically multiple areas layered by either making use of transparency or perspective. It can be used instead of a multiple ***LineSeries*** to compare development of a trend, to search patterns and relationships both within a collection and across collections over the period.
